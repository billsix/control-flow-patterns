control-flow-patterns

Object-Oriented design patterns, UML, and Sequence Diagrams
have received much attention by the programming industry
over the decades.
One notable pattern, the Iterator,
has become so ubiquitous that designers of programming languages (e.g., Python, C#)
have made it a pattern of the language by adding explicit syntax, thus relieving the
user of the language from coding the pattern manually.

These code examples explore how languages and libraries use control flow
to simplfy their user's experience.  In it, I will explore the issues
of non-reponsive systems due to blocking IO, and the solutions over time;
such as select, threads, and async.
I will explore UI systems, from command line interfaces, to GUIs,
which introduced inversion of control.

"Gotos are evil" doesn't specify what to do; only what to avoid.
